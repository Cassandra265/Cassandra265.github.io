# About Me

<img src="https://casslii.github.io/images/cass.jpg" class="floatpic" >

Here is **Wanxin Li (Cass)**. 




I hold a Master's degree in Spatial Data Science from the University of Southern California, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Environment Science with a focus on Geomatics from the University of Waterloo and Capital Normal University. My expertise lies in spatial data science, GIS, and remote sensing, with hands-on experience in developing deep learning models. My focus is on solving real-world problems through geospatial technology.



Recently, I am looking for **GIS related jobs**. If you are interested in me, please email me at - *wanxinli@usc.com*

## Academic Background

- **Sep 2022 - May 2024:** University of Southern California (M.S. in Spatial Data Scinece)
- **Sep 2020 - June 2022:** University of Waterloo (BESc, Geomatics, Minor Math)
- **Sep 2018 - June 2020:** Capital Normal University (BSc, GIS)

## Research Interests

- GIS and urban development
- GeoAI
- Deep learning and Machine Learning in remote sensing



I'm currently working on a research project with Dr. Yi Qi at USC, focused on mapping and tracking urban trees in Los Angeles using **machine learning** and **deep learning models**. We're using large-scale data, including NAIP imagery and meta canopy height datasets, to identify and classify tree species. Our goal is to improve the understanding of urban tree distribution and support better urban planning and ecological management.
