## Urban Tree Project
### Research focus: large-scale urban tree tracking and mapping, deep learning and machine learning models
-	Developed a scalable workflow for mapping and tracking over 70,000 urban trees species in Los Angles
-	Led the research on USC tree mapping using NAIP data and random forest; achieved over 68% accuracy in species identification, enhancing ecological insights for the USC campus environment
-	Implemented multi levels tree species classification combine 4-bands imagery and meta canopy height dataset and using deep learning methods. Conducted reclassification based on 100 tree species for analysis

The figure below shows our workflow:

##### Los Angeles Geospatial Summit Esri ArcGIS StoryMap Competition -- 2024 Geospatial Summit

In the 2024 Geospatial summit, we shows a test area for the urban tree research. Here is a link to our [USC Campous Tree Detetct Project](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/01c9dd1586954854a395453c11b0c999), this project is fcous on the campus level tree speices classfication. The map below shows our results for the tree sepeices classfication, the research is based on random forest.

## Urbanization Time Series Analysis
Arranged a 20-year land use classification study in Wuhan city using Landsat 8 images. In this study, the ground features are classified into urban, water, bare and vegetation. The unsupervised classification and the supervised classification are both be used to the land cover/use detection. The results indicated that Wuhan has a high rate of urbanization with the urban area expanding 3-4 times during the 30 years, the change of water resources was the least during the 30 years.

## Spatial Pattern Analysis

A case study in the United States during January and October in 2021 to research on the spatial pattern of how each state performs under some typical trade-off criteria by utilizing the index and a Moran’s I analysis with queen-based spatial weight matrix. By employing the modified the Moran’s I analysis, the pattern of how flights and COVID-19 interact can be found. As a result, two states with higher volume of exchanged flight passengers tend to have similar pandemic control performance. The case applies especially on the southeastern part of the US.
